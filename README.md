# Extension Analysis + Overlap

# This code was inspired by an analysis pipeline developped by the Fermi Lat Collaboration : "Searching for Spatial Extension in High Latitude Sources Detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope". It tests for extension using Fermi Telescope data and performs overlap calculation to test IR-Gamma associations using "fermipy" python module.

# genConfig.py : generates the config file needed for the fermipy analysis
# multiProcessRun.py : parallelized analysis on each cluster
# statistictica.py : file containing the analysis Class
